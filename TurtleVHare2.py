
# Turtle v Hare
'''
This program uses 3 different functions which are combined into a
main function to simulate the famous race between the tortoise and the hare
It is 50 'seconds' long and uses probability to determine the animalâ€™s next move
the time it takes to complete a race and the winner is then displayed
